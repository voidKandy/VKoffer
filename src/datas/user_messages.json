In your local repository, add the remote GitHub repository URL using the following command:\n\n   ```\n   git remote add origin <remote repository URL>\n   ```\n\n3. Next, stage your changes using the following command:\n\n   ```\n   git add .\n   ```\n\n4. Commit your changes with a commit message using the following command:\n\n   ```\n   git commit -m \"commit message\"\n   ```\n\n5. Finally, push your changes to the remote repository using the following command:\n\n   ```\n   git push -u origin master\n   ```\n\nThis will push your current repository"

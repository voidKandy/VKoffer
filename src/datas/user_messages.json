Run `git push` followed by the name of the remote repository and the branch you want to push to. For example, if your remote repository is named \"origin\" and you want to push to the \"main\" branch, you would run `git push origin main`.\n\nHere's an example of the full command:\n\n```\ngit push origin main\n```\n\nThis will push your changes to the \"main\" branch of the \"origin\" remote repository."
